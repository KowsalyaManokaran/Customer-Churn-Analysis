# Customer-Churn-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project aims to identify customers likely to churn based on historical transaction data and visualize key insights using Power BI. The goal is to support businesses in improving customer retention strategies.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Power BI – Dashboard for business insights
- Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing support
- Dataset: customer_churn.csv (Public E-commerce data)
## Key Steps Performed

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned missing and inconsistent values using Pandas
- Removed duplicates and handled null entries
- Feature engineering for better model input

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize customer behavior
- Uncovered trends in churn based on region, product type, and purchase patterns

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest using Scikit-learn
- Encoded categorical variables and applied feature scaling
- Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix

### 4. Business Dashboard
- Built a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:
  - Churn vs Non-Churn counts
  - Key churn indicators
  - Product-wise and region-wise churn stats

---

## Output Highlights
- Achieved strong classification accuracy
- Identified top churn-driving factors
- Helped visualize insights with a business-ready dashboard
